# Python Coding Test Practice 🐍💻

This repository is my personal space for improving my coding test skills.  
I aim to **solve at least three problems every day** to strengthen my problem-solving abilities.  
Rather than just a study log, I see this as a journey to track my progress and growth.

## 🔹 Goals
- Build a solid understanding of algorithms & data structures  
- Enhance problem-solving skills through consistent practice  
- Write clean and efficient Python code  

## 📂 Folder Structure
📌 **Problems are organized by date** (e.g., `13_March/Example_1.py`).  
📌 Each solution includes comments explaining the approach and key ideas.  

## 📌 My Personal Rules
✅ Solve at least **three problems per day**  
✅ Challenge myself with different problem types  
✅ Refactor and optimize solutions when necessary  
✅ Keep pushing through even when problems get tough!  

## 🚀 Where Do the Problems Come From?
I mainly solve problems from **Baekjoon, Programmers, and LeetCode**.  
Along the way, I focus on writing **efficient solutions** and improving my algorithmic thinking.  

Thank you!

# Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers at distinct indices in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

# Return the sum of the three integers.

# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
 

# Constraints:

# 3 <= nums.length <= 500
# -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
# -104 <= target <= 104
